In this project, I implemented a Treasure Hunters game to find the optimal path to get treasure while avoiding obstacles and opponents by using reinforcement learning. The enviornment map includes rocks, monsters, treasure, and blank road.

# Project Instruction
We do the treasure hunting and monster fighting for you  
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account   
2. Think up a map-like environment with treasure, obstacles and opponents   
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)   
4. Formulate ideas on how reinforcement learning can be used to find treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles and opponents   
5. Build one or more reinforcement policies to model situational assessments, actions and rewards programmatically   
6. Document your process and results    
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub   

# Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning

I used Q-learning startegy for my reinforcement learning algorithm, the Q-learning algorithm is given by the equation:  
$Q(S_t,%20A_t)$
